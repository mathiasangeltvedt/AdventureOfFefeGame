About the Game:
- Our game is inspired by Celeste, a type of explorer game where the player must jump through challenging levels while finding collectibles scattered around the map. In the game, you can pick up various power-ups that allow you to double dash.
- You control the player with WASD, jump with Spacebar, dash with J and climb with K.
- We created custom graphics, including backgrounds, characters, platforms, etc., to make the game more lively for players.
